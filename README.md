# StatusPlugin
Status Plugin of PvPHub Management

The plugin was used for my own plugin services.
The user was abled to join our server to see the progress of the plugin.
When a user ordered a plugin he got a private server and a token for his plugin so that he could
test it whenever he wanted to.
The plugin service was shutdowned in 2020.
